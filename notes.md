    * auc roc
    * vote classifier
    * how this under sampling works in RandomUnderSampler, what sampling_strategy represents
    * how to use optuna for lightgbm param tuning
* use optuna for lightgbm param tuning

* custom metric, maybe it could be better than auc

### Important questions
* how stratified group k fold works?
* what is auc roc and why it was used?
* how gradient boosting works in lightgbm?
* why lightgbm used instead of xgboost or catboost?
